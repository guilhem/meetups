__title__: Scale your Prometheus monitoring with Thanos

__expected time__ : 20m

__abstract__: There is one name you will hear as soon as you start looking for cloud monitoring: Prometheus. This CNCF project took the container monitoring world by storm & is now supported by a huge open source community.

Then after some time operating & using Prometheus you will eventually face the traditional challenges of scaling & keep maintenance cost at bay.
At Talend we met those challenges some years ago and we have solved them using Thanos.

I would like to share with you how SRE team can expand their Prometheus stacks with a selection of Thanos components, what those components can do for you and also the limits of such monitoring stack.
