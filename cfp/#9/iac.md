__title__: Datacenter Unplugged

__expected time__ : 15m

__abstract__: What if I pull the plug of the datacenter ? What if someone ran a script deleting all my cloud resources ? What if my AWS organization is deleted by "mistake"
?
This scenarios can be horrific or fearless, depending on the answer of this question: is my infra as code ?

In this session, we will talk about IaC and more specifically the transition from IaDN (Infra as /dev/null) to IaC. How can you adapt your workflow and your legacy infra without impacting your running resources. We will go through an actual example: starting from a legacy infra, how can we generate and manipulate IaC to make the infra persistent.
