__title__: Scaphandre: understand and shrink the energy consumption of your infrastructure

__expected time__ : 10m

__abstract__: We are facing a climate crisis due to... ourselves (I mean mankind, not only SREs). One vector of this crisis is greenhouse gazes emissions.

One factor of those greenhouse gazes emissions is electricity consumption (electricity doesn't appear magically right ?) and our industry consumes quite a lot of electricity.

Let see how we could tamper that, using the best collaboration method we have: open source and open collaboration.

I'll present the scaphandre project and it's perspectives.
