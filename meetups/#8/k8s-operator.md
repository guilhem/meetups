**title**: Hello, Operator? Give Me a Resilient Data Processing Pipeline

**expected time** : 30 minutes

**abstract**: While building a platform for on-demand data processing pipelines,
Padok wrote a Kubernetes operator to answer specific scheduling needs. This
allowed their SREs to maximize resilience while minimizing resource waste. In
this talk, Arthur will share his experience in developing this operator,
including what problem it solves, what open source tools in was built with, and
why it was definitely worth it.
